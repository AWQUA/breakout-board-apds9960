#Gesture sensor APDS-9960

This handy little sensor can detect basic motion patterns (such as moving left or right, up or down, near or far) of objects a few inches away from it. This was (apparently) the same gesture sensor used in the Samsung Galaxy S5 phone.  

We are incorporating this sensor into our upcoming `pocket-turbidimeter`, so that users can simply gesture to the device what they want it to do. Great for keeping your monitoring tools clean even when your hands get dirty.  

Sparkfun sells a nice version of this board. Presented here is a minimal breakout of this sensor, ready for fabrication and assembly.  

Enjoy!
